# project-work
==============

In here you will find some examples of my Data Science project work.

There are also examples of work on the Titanic dataset and some initial statistical analysis.

My main project is Gone to the Dogs - a project on predicting the outcome of greyhound racing.

In here you will find my original reports for the General Assembly Capstone project. These are labelled Capstone 4 and Linear regression modelling.

There are also some further notebooks:

greyhound_reference_table: This is a small and short demo on how I would look to eventually start storing the data in a relational database format.

web_scraper: This is how I get my information

dataframe_updater: This is an example of the Data engineering involved in any upkeep of this project.  In addition there is an example of running a model on the data and the achievable precision that can be achieved in terms of predicting the outcome of greyhound races.

Please feel free to contact me for further information.
